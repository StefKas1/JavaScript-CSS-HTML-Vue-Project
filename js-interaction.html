            <p>
              GitHub repository link to this website:
              <a
                href="https://github.com/StefKas1/Web-Application"
                target="_blank"

            </p>
            <h3>All pages contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
              This is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project - the frontend was
              implemented without frameworks (with the exception of the page
              <strong>'Vue pets'</strong>, which was implemented with the Vue.js
              framework to show Vue.js functionality). And in the backend,
              hosted on Heroku, the Express.js framework was used for Node.js to
              connect the frontend to a MongoDB. The goal of this project is to
              tell something about myself and to showcase what I learned in the
              course Web Application Development at BU.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Content of each page</h3>
            <p>
              The web page <strong>'About me'</strong> provides general
              information about me and shows images of the region where I live.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>'Reading'</strong> page gives a short list of books I
              would like to read.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>'First name - multilingual'</strong> page shows how my
              first name is spelled in Germanic and Romance languages and
              contains an audio recording of how my name is pronounced in
              German.
            </p>
            <p>
              This <strong>'JavaScript interaction'</strong> page contains three
              interactive JavaScript applications: the first application uses
              alert and prompt windows to add two numbers (with input
              validation). The second application hides or shows explanations
              about the pages of this website. And the third application fetches
              information from the NASA API and displays the information on the
              page.
            </p>
            <p>
              The page <strong>'Vue pets'</strong> shows four images of our
              pets. Hovering over an image will change the image to an image of
              the same pet â€“ when it was younger. And the page contains a few
              small interactions via input elements. The page was created with
              Vue.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>'Give feedback'</strong> page enables the user to send
              feedback via form elements to Express.js / Node.js, which is
              hosted on Heroku, where the feedback (in JSON format) is inserted
              into a MongoDB. All feedback is loaded from the MongoDB and
              displayed on the <strong>'Give feedback'</strong> page, where
              every feedback element in the MongoDB can be deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>'Contact me'</strong> page contains a contact form
              which the user can use to send a message to
              <a href="mailto:kasperza@bu.edu">kasperza@bu.edu</a> using the
              POST method; before the web form is sent, its entries are
              validated via JavaScript. For sending, the message is first sent
              to
              <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank">formsubmit.co</a
              >, which sends the message to
              <a href="mailto:kasperza@bu.edu">kasperza@bu.edu</a>. And all
              pages were implemented with the CSS Grid Layout and media queries
              so that the positioning of the HTML elements is adapted to the
              display dimensions (responsiveness).

          <h2>3. NASA's astronomy picture of the day</h2>
          <p>
            I have loved everything to do with astronomy since I was a child. I
            have looked at interactive deep space maps for hundreds of hours,
            probably know every crater on the moon, and have more telescopes
            than space in my apartment. Astronomy is so fantastic that when the
            sky is clear, I can gaze into the starry sky and vastness of space
            for hours. And when I found out that NASA offers a free API for
            their data, of course I had to build that into my portfolio.
